profile: |
  A motivated computer scientist driven to create solutions and turn ideas into reality through technology, always striving for excellence in my projects. Throughout 2024, I served for one year as a Teaching Assistant for the Algorithms and Data Structures I, II, and III courses, an experience that honed my communication and teaching skills. In 2024, alongside three partners, I co-founded COMP Junior Enterprise, a student-run technology company. I currently serve as the Director of the Technical Department, leading projects and contributing to the company's growth.

projects:
  - title: Wi-Fi Phishing
    link: https://github.com/thomneuenschwander/wifi-phishing
    details: |
      An educational tool created to demonstrate the Wi-Fi Phishing social engineering technique via a malicious Captive Portal. This project aims to build practical skills in core networking and security concepts using popular Linux tools.

  - title: Graph Theory Implementations
    link: https://github.com/thomneuenschwander/tp-grafos
    details: |
      A repository containing practical assignments developed for the Graph Theory course in the Computer Science program at PUC Minas. This project features the implementation of key algorithms, including the identification of biconnected components and a solution to the k-centers problem.

  - title: Algorithm Analysis and Design Implementations
    link: https://github.com/thomneuenschwander/tp-grafos
    details: |
      This project, developed for an Algorithm Analysis and Design course, tackles two classic graph optimization problems: the Longest Simple Cycle and the Minimum Dominating Set. It features a comparative analysis of three distinct algorithmic approaches for each problem—Brute-Force, Branch-and-Bound, and Heuristics. The complete solution, including a graphical interface for visualization, was implemented in Java.
