## Local Development with Docker
To facilitate local development and previewing changes, this project includes a Dockerized environment. This allows you to run the site without installing Ruby or any other dependencies directly on your system.

### Running the development server
Once you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed, you can start the local server with a single command from the project root:
```bash
docker compose up
```
